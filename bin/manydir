#  A script for performing same operation 
#	in subdirectories recursively
#  The magic is in the find command which prints all subdirectories 
#	except for hidden directories
# For non recursive directory action, this is easier:
# for dir in `ls -d $1*`

startdir=$PWD
for dir in `find $1 \( -name '.*' -prune \) -o \( -type d -print \)`
do
	cd $startdir
	cd $dir
	echo $dir
	gridclean
	/bin/rm dump.*
done
