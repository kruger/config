Misc
-----
Add my own code snippets
Need to change tmux mappings to use COMMAND or ALT so that vim takes control
See: https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim/wiki/Extensions
  Having mason do the null-ls and dap installations may be a good idea
Should I be using MasonInstall instead of LspInstall?

Debugging
----------
grammarly is quitting with exit code 1 and signal 0.  Not sure if I need it

toggleterm would be better if CTRL-\ but that conflicts with tmux

Null-ls
-------------------
See ./lua/user/lsp/null-ls.lua for list of formatters to play with
Need to make sure I have null-ls working for all of my filetypes
Understand spell completions
How does tags work?
gitsigns for null-ls

 
Plugins to research and configure
