Basically, xdvi can only show EPS files inserted in the LaTeX.
It cannot deal with general PostScript addenda.
PSTricks is extremely powerful,
and can insert PostScript in all sorts of unlikely places.

Of course you can view it with ghostview or ghostscript (gs)

latex myfile
dvips -o myfile.ps myfile
ghostview myfile.ps

 Redefine sections/*{{{*/

\@startsection{name}{level}{indent}{beforeskip}{afterskip}{style}

which lets you define your own personalized sectioning commands.  this
will do exactly what you want.

you could also \renewcommand{\chapter} using \@startsection if you like a
chapter being called a chapter.

see page 24--27 in the companion.

 EPS Trick using psfrag /*{{{*/

From Tony Lacey <a.lacey@sheffield.ac.uk>
Subject: Re: Drawing program for X (not XFig)

Just in case your still interested there is quite a smart thing that
latex2e lets you do now with eps images.  If the eps image contains some
text you can replace this text with latex text.  How is this useful you
may ask?  Well you can replace any text in an eps file with not only
latex text which will then be of the same font and type as the rest of
the text, but also with latex equations.  For instance I just add tags
in the Xfig drawing and use these to locate equations within the latex. 
The class package is called psfrag and is widely available.

Also you might like to take a look at gnuplot.  This is a 2D and 3D
plotting program (you may be aware of this sorry if you are).  Gnuplot
outputs fig format graphs which can then be pulled into Xfig for a bit
of "tarting up" and then output at eps.  This coupled with psfrag might
help you out.

A float specification of [h] translates into English as `please take this
float and all following ones to the end of the document' LaTeX2.09 used to
believe you really meant that, current LaTeX releases generate a
warning message and change that to [ht] before doing anything else.

You should use \centering *before* starting the paragraph (actually it
works anyway, but it just looks a bit odd mid paragraph).

The \leavevmode (which isn't strictly a LaTeX command) is not needed
unless you are using a very old buggy epsfig package. In fact
\leavevmode should never be needed in LaTeX documents: All LaTeX box
constructs start a paragraph automatically.

epsfig (even the current version) is not recommended, it is really
just distributed for the benefit of old documents. You should use the
graphics or graphicx packages instead.


\begin{figure}[hpt]
 \centering
 \includegraphics{foo.eps}
 \caption{A picture of foo}
\end{figure}
